This can help companies understand public opinion about the market situation and take any action more quickly.

We took a dataset with comments, performed work on describing the mood of the comment and divided it into 5 classes from the most negative to the most positive ( -2,-1,0,1,2 ) where -2 is a negative comment, 0 is neutral, 2 is positive. 

Next, we take a news portal where there are news about oil, comments and tags to the news. 

We take tags and comments to the news with the help of parsing and analyze the mood of users. Then we build statistics on the connection of tags and the mood of comments.
As a result, we get several graphs of the most popular information guides and user reactions to them.
